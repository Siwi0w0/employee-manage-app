- **Read Employee Records**: View all the employee details in a comprehensive dashboard.
- **Update Employee Records**: Modify existing employee information.
- **Delete Employee Records**: Remove employee data from the system.

## Technologies Used

- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database to store employee data.
- **Express.js**: Backend framework running on Node.js.
- **React.js**: Frontend library used for building the user interface.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code server-side.
